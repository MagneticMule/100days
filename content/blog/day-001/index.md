## What did I do?

So yeah, I took the easy opion here. I created a Gatsby based blog based off the now infamous [Gatsby blog template](http://example.com "Gatsby Blog Template"). I knew I needed a private (yet chekkily public) space to record my progress each day and I knew that I didn't want to write on something like [Dev.to](https://dev.to/ "Dev.to") as to be brutally frank I am doing this purely for me. I am not interested in feedback (as of yet) or critical discussion on the minutae of dev tools. So, a simple Gatsby based blog it was. Also, I liked the idea of everythig being hosted on Netlify that is tied to a Github repo with all blog entried being housed in simple MarkDown files. Suits me.

## How did I do it?

Well, I already had Gatsby and all it's dependencies installed via NPM. I am using WIndows on my main machine as I git tired of Apple and it's flakey machines. However, I can't say I enjoy Windows as a Dev environment, it's good for games though. Powershell is a poor replacement for a good old ZSH command line but I digress.

Starting a new Gatsby site with a standard blog starter is simple.

`gatsby new gatsby-starter-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog`

There are a wealth of [Gatsby Starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/? Gatsby Starter Templates) you can use to get started but I picked the first one I found. I don't have the time to mess around too much here so keeping things simple is a central concern.

I didn't do a great deal to the starter template, just cahnged the favicon and bio. I may come back and change things later but I need to get this thing up and out the way.

## What did I learn?

For me the purpose of 100 days of code is to focus on learning one thing a day or at least discivering something new. TO be frank, I didn;t learn much wiht this project. I already know GatsbyJS reasonably well and have used it for two client projects (yes, paying clients). However, as is the case with much of my dev practice I am rusty. Here I get a chance to write in MarkDown each day, something I haven't done since 2005.
